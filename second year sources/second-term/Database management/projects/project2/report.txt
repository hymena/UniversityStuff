Introduction

01
Our project was not about storing data for a company or an establishment, it was
a game.
The idea of the game is simple, each player owns a bunch of birds. The player can
buy and sell them, train them, send them to performances and breed them.
Each bird has 3 main ‘stats’, agility, speed and singing quality. The higher these
are, the better of a quality the bird is. Birds with higher stats produce more
ingame credits for their owners when they do a performance.
If a player wants new birds without wanting to buy them, they can breed their
existing birds, which will result in them laying eggs. Eggs hatch after a while and
produce new birds.
Birds can be equipped with accessories, which improves their performance if
they’re either training or doing a show. Training birds mostly improves their stats,
which sending them to a performance (show) gains their owner ingame credits.
After an activity, birds tend to get hungry. Players can purchase food so that they
can feed their birds. They should be careful though, some foods (especially cheap

ones) are unhealthy and can affect the birds’ performance in the activities nega-
tively.

►We will keep track of all USERs, including their email [Email], account pass

word [Password], username (unique) [Username], nickname (not unique) [Nick-
name], ingame credits (money) [Credits], experience points [XP] and level

[Level].
►Each user will have a minimum of two BIRDs, which each have an ID [ID],
name [Name], gender [Gender], date of birth[Date_Of_Birth], a ‘for-sale’ flag
[For_Sale], a sale price [Price], which will only be significant if the pet is for sale,
and a multivalued look attribute [Look] that will describe the look of the bird.
Each pet is related to a player [OWNS].
►Birds have some functional attributes. We keep track of their breed cooldown
[Breed_Cooldown], which is the minimum time a bird isn’t allowed to breed with
another. We also keep track of their activity cooldown [Activity_Cooldown],
which is the minimum time a bird isn’t allowed to do an activity, either it being
training or doing a performance. We also keep track of the hunger of each bird
[Hunger]. A food tracker attribute [Food_Tracker] is there, which will track the
‘healthiness’ of the food the bird eats. We store the values for agility [Agility],

speed [Speed] and singing quality [Singing_Quality] of each bird, which affects
how well does the bird perform in performances and trainings.
►Birds can breed. Whenever they breed, the mother lays EGGs. We keep track
of those eggs. We store their ID [ID], date of creation [Date_Of_Creation], their

hatch time [Hatch_Time], and some visual properties such as its colors [Egg_Col-
or1] and [Egg_Color2]. We also connect each egg to its parents with two rela-
tionships [MOTHER_OF_EGG], [FATHER_OF_EGG]. We also keep track of the user

owning the egg with the relationship [OWNS_EGG]
►Each player owns several NESTs [OWNS_NEST]. We keep track of the nest’s ID
[ID], name [Name], style [Nest_Style], main and secondary color [Main_Color],
[Secondary_Color], price [Price]. We also store the quality of the nest. The time
quality attribute [Time_Quality] will affect the time the eggs hatch in, and the
stats quality [Stats_Quality] will affect the agility, speed and singing quality of the
birds when they hatch from the eggs that were laying in the nest. A nest can be
occupied by a maximum of one bird in a living relationship [LIVES]. Whenever a
bird lays eggs, they lay them in the nest which they live in, which is a relation

between eggs and nests [SITS].
►Birds can do ACTIVITIES, which is an entity dependant on the existence of a
bird. Each activity has a name [Activty_Name], a starting time [Start_Time], a
duration [Duration], and a type (race, singing or stunts) [Activity_Type]. Activities
divide into two types, performances [PERFORMANCE] or trainings [TRAINING].
Each performance has rating [Rating], which defines how good the performance
was. Each training has difficulty [Difficulty]. Trainings with more difficulty usually
take more time and might hurt the bird, but might benefit it more. We track the
activities of a bird with the relationship [DOES].
►Users can buy ACCESSORIES for their birds [OWNS_ACCESSORY]. Accessories
can improve a birds activity around speed, agility and singing. Each accessory
has an ID [ID], a name [Name], a type [Type], and three quality attributes for

each the agility [Agility_Quality], speed [Speed_Quality] and singing [Sing-
ing_Quality], which describe how well this accessory can improve the bird using

it in those 3 fields. We keep track of the accessories used by a bird with the
relation [USES_ACCESSORY], which has attributes of the familiarity [Familiarity].

►The more familiar a bird is with an accessory the better it affects it. Another
attribute is a flag [Holds]. One bird can use multiple accessories, but not at
once. At one time, the bird only uses one accessory. That flag keeps track of
which accessory is currently being used by a bird and which aren’t.

►Users can buy FOOD for their birds. Each food has a type [Type], a quantity
[Quantity]. We also keep track of how healthy a food is [Healthiness] and how
much hunger does it restore to the bird eating it [Restoration].
